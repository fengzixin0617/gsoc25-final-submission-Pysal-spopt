# GSOC25-final-submission - Flow Refuelling Location Model 

## Summary
1. Fork the repo (pysal-spopt) and create a dev branch [add-frlm-feature](https://github.com/fengzixin0617/spopt/tree/add-frlm-feature)
2. [Pull request](https://github.com/pysal/spopt/pull/487)
3. Create a set of [Flow Refuelling Location Models](https://github.com/fengzixin0617/spopt/blob/add-frlm-feature/spopt/locate/flow.py)
4. Create a corresponding [notebook for the models](https://github.com/fengzixin0617/spopt/blob/add-frlm-feature/notebooks/flow.ipynb)
5. Create code [test](https://github.com/fengzixin0617/spopt/blob/add-frlm-feature/spopt/tests/test_locate/test_flow.py)
6. Document the learning process with [blogs](https://fengzixin0617.github.io/gsoc2025/) 

## Task 0.
Before starting the project, I reviewed academic papers on Flow Refuelling Location Models (FRLM), as these models are closely related to my PhD research. At that time, I was new to software engineering practices, including object-oriented programming (OOP) and collaborative workflows such as GitHubâ€™s push/pull/fork process. My initial tasks therefore focused on becoming familiar with these tools and practices.

## Task 1. 
I began by developing an initial draft of the basic Flow Refuelling Location Model (FRLM). I then extended this draft by incorporating the threshold-based version of the model, followed by the capacitated version. After I gained a better understanding of OOP, I refactored the code into an object-oriented structure.

Each of the three models can be solved using either Exact solver or Greedy solver. 

## Task 2. 

I then submitted my first [Pull request](https://github.com/pysal/spopt/pull/487), which went through two rounds of code review by my mentors.
